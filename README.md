# Clustering Kazakhstanâ€™s popular news sources
Personal Project
Author: Malika Parkhomchuk

Part 1: Identifying popular news sources (part1-Modified.html)

1. Gathered recent tweets according to query words
2. Gathered expanded urls from tweets
3. Created a data frame of all the gathered links and their source domains
4. Got the top 30 news sources by the frequency of occurrence

Conclusion for Part 1 of the project:
Most of the links were retweets of other tweets, so that was not very helpful for my investigation of news sources. However, there are still alot of interesting sources to look at. For instance, egov.press is Kazakhstan's governmental source for getting information on documentations, pension, social security and etc. tengrinews.kz, inbusiness.kz, kaz.orda.kz, egemen.kz, akorda.kz, inform.kz, ktk.kz, baigenews.kz are big news portals that mostly work of governmental orders. azattyq.kz, vlast.kz are knows and popular independent sources of information. Also, people from Kazakstan use Youtube, Instagram and TikTok to look out for the news.
